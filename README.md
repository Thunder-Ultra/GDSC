# Create a GitHub Readme.md file with title "Learning Git"

This code block creates a new file named "README.md" in the root directory of a GitHub repository with the title "Learning Git". The file is written in Markdown format, which is a lightweight markup language used to format text on the web.

Markdown is a popular choice for creating documentation files on GitHub, as it allows for easy formatting of text, images, and links. By creating a README.md file in your repository, you can provide important information about your project, such as installation instructions, usage examples, and project goals.

To create a new README.md file, simply copy the code block and paste it into the command line or terminal of your GitHub repository. Make sure to replace "Learning Git" with the title of your choice.
